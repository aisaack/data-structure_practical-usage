# This is for studing APIs and practical usecase of data structure 
## APIs?
* API stands for Application Programming Interface which helps communicating other products and services.

It's like calling a function from different application. Once one of the parties sends request to retrieve a data then other one returns response.

### Linked list
![Linkedlist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65937735/134629827-83214185-037a-420f-af39-684cd374b39f.png)

Linked list stores elements linearly in seperate storage. Each element called node having 2 properties which stores an item and references next node. There are 3 types of linked list.
1. SIngly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular LInked List

#### Given a linked list has n node
* Accessing time: O(n)
* Search time: O(n)
* Insertion time: O(1). When a user is aware of where to insert an element
* Deletion time: O(1). When a user is aware target element of prior element's address
